			<p><strong>The Ultimate UI/UX Problem</strong></p>
			<p>In the area of UI and UX design, there are some some elements that designers take as a fundamental pillars on which all design stands. For as far as human history goes, we have always designed things. From ancient cave drawings all the way to software running on modern smartphones and upcoming VR and AR platforms. All of these designs have one thing in common - they were designed for human beings. Human beings who have the five senses: the sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. Designers across the millennia have relied on these fundamental senses that human beings poses to design the world around us, from messages to monuments.</p>
			<p>In the 20th Century, humanity embarked upon a new era since it's existence - space travel. We have achieved many amazing feats in space travel which the cherry on top being landing on the moon. But there are two space programs that were milestones in humanity declaring their presence in the Universe. I am referring to the Pioneer and the Voyager programs. What's special about these two programs is that they sent out the first intergalactic messages on behalf of humanity. Pioneer 10 and 11 followed by Voyager 1 and 2 had the following plaques and disks attached to their bodies:</p>

			<img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/3a7df5a1df1840fc1544e85f78bc491d/tumblr_inline_om0uwfzU6E1u2a8lx_500.png" width="300" style="box-sizing: border-box;" data-orig-height="2215" data-orig-width="2215" />
			<p></p>
			<p>The idea behind these messages were that if any other intelligent life forms ever are able to intercept the spacecrafts, then hopefully they will be able to see these messages and know we have sent them. Perhaps they might even understand who we are and why we sent them. Herein lies the ultimate UI and UX challenge I alluded to before.</p>
			<p>How can we possibly know what these intelligent life forms are? Furthermore, we have no idea if they have the same five senses we have. That brings up the question, if we have no idea who or what these life forms may be, how in the world can we send them a message? It's one thing to send a message to a human being who maybe speaks a language different than you or me, in that case we can rely on maybe using symbols and drawings to convey a message. But in the case of intergalactic alien lifeforms, how do we even know they have eyes to see with? Or any form of written language? These are the questions that makes designing a message for an alien species one of the hardest UI and UX problems ever.</p>
			<p>A similar challenge that designers have had to tackle in the recent years has been dealing with nuclear waste. The Human Interference Task Force has had the very important task of writing a message for humanity ten thousand years in the future. See, the nuclear waste we have buried deep in the ground of the earth will take millions of years to decay until their emitted radiation drops to a level that is not harmful for life. However in ten thousand years, that nuclear waste will be still as harmful as it is today. But, we won't be around to warn the humans of that time, then who will? This is why the Human Interference Task Force was tasked on creating a message that could be recognized by humans of the 120th Century Earth.</p>
			<p>This is one of the signs that they created:</p>
			<img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/8f479fe634ce4f5339f0b910745769b7/tumblr_inline_om0uwo8R6c1u2a8lx_500.png" width="500" style="box-sizing: border-box;" data-orig-height="593" data-orig-width="716" />

			<p>As one can imagine, no language in human history has been known to last ten centuries. We really have no idea how humans will evolve in the next few thousands of years. This is why it makes it very difficult to design a message for the future. This is what makes this design problem among the hardest to solve.</p>
			<p>For my design portfolio, I will be trying to tackle the latter problem of designing a message for humans of 120th Century Earth to warn them of the danger of nuclear waste areas.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Requirements for The Message:</strong></p>
			<p>According to the Human Interference Task Force</p>
			<ol>
				<li>that it is a message at all</li>
				<li>that dangerous material is stored in a given location</li>
				<li>information about the type of dangerous substances</li>
				
				<li>The message needs to have instructions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>To stay away</li>
						<li>What to do if contaminated</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Needs to catch attention</li>
				<li>Needs to survive outdoors for thousands of years</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Immune to corrosion</li>
						<li>Immune to decay and damage</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Information about the dangerous substances</li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong>Research into possible UI elements that can be used: </strong></p>
			<p><strong>Symbols that can be used:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Skull and Crossbones: Almost always interpreted as sign of death. Symbol has survived thousands of years. Very good candidate.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/45ea6491247389f5645a376699427098/tumblr_inline_om4rxqdiJj1u2a8lx_500.png" /></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Nuclear Radiation: Very well known now, but it's a very recent 20th century symbol. No guarantees it will survive the coming thousands of years.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/1fe251e1fb4d6342ef31323401f8a447/tumblr_inline_om4rywpsu81u2a8lx_500.png" /></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Exclamation: Generally treated as symbol of warning: Again, seems to be a very recent 20th century design. May mean something completely different in a thousand years.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/e9bc7b8da3a580df5dfdfb98a8a1a818/tumblr_inline_om4s037rRZ1u2a8lx_500.png" /></p>
			<p></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Stick Figures: Another strong candidate. Stick figures can be more expressive than abstract symbols. It maybe possible to show some actions using stick figures that will stand the test of time. We can look at cave paintings and understand that our ancestors were hunters. Stick figures have survived for thousands of centuries. Very strong candidate indeed.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/5adcf694ccd2e8c36e294f148a38d5e2/tumblr_inline_om4s18CtB11u2a8lx_500.png" /></p>
			<p><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/1c816143f8d94ce0df75574420f010a7/tumblr_inline_om4s2fOOYa1u2a8lx_500.png" /></p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Colors that can be used:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Bright Colors that can catch attention</li>
				<li>Red</li>
				<li>Bright Yellow</li>
				<li>Bright Orange</li>
				<li>These colors are pretty common, but they are common for a good reason. These are colors that have come to convey urgent and seek for attention. Other colors like Blue or Green don't have the same effect. However, who knows if these colors will hold the same meaning in a thousand or more years.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>One material that can last corrosion is plastic. If the message board is made of high grade thick plastic, that might be good enough for it to not erode over time. It will help to preserve the message for a long time.</li>
				<li>Highly reflective coating should be placed on top of the plastic so that it shines light to draw attention. It will also help it to be readable in low light conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>It may be beneficial to use some rudimentary digital technology to add to the message:</li>
				<li>Solar powered electronics ensure unlimited source of power</li>
				<li>Adding motion detectors can activate different things to fend off anyone who comes close</li>
				<li>Flashing lights will help scare anyone or anything coming close</li>
				<li>High pitched sirens will also deter anyone from coming close.</li>
				<li>Even possibility using a combination of flashing lights and sirens to scare anyone away might be very handy.</li>
